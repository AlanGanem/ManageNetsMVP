# MangeNets MVP

ManageNets is a web application and framework for process modelling inspired by the the AAR (Actor-Actions-Resourves)
model and State Space Machines.

The main goal is to shed some light on the operational structure of an organization or any delivering system, allowing processes
to be mapped in a distributed manner and enhancing the use of network analysis tools in process management. Also, more organic governance
can be designed for complex systems starting from the operational level towards the organizational (bottom-up), instead of the
top down aproax commonly taken.
